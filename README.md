OBJECTIVE:Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and secure communication.

TOOL: ProtonVPN free tier

STEP 1- Choose a reputable free VPN service and sign up
Go to https://protonvpn.com.

Click "Get ProtonVPN Free".

Select the Free plan.

Create an account with your email and a secure password.

Verify your email address (check inbox/spam).

STEP 2- Download and instal the VPN client.

On the ProtonVPN site, go to Downloads.

Download and run the installer.

Follow the installation prompts.

STEP 3- Connect to a VPN server (choose closest or any location).

Wait until the status shows “Connected” and you see the new IP address in the app.

STEP 4- Verify your IP address has changed (use whatismyipaddress.com)

Open your browser and go to https://whatismyipaddress.com.

Check if your IP location matches the VPN server location.

STEP 5- Browse a website to confirm traffic is encrypted.

Open websites as usual. Your ISP and local network can’t see your browsing activity (only that you’re connected to ProtonVPN).

STEP 6- Disconnect VPN and compare browsing speed and IP

Disconnect in the ProtonVPN app

Check your IP again — it should return to your normal ISP address.

Compare browsing speed with and without VPN.

STEP 7- Research VPN encryption and privacy features.

ProtonVPN Free uses AES-256 encryption + Perfect Forward Secrecy.

They have a no-logs policy audited by independent security researchers.

Free plan has unlimited data, but fewer servers.

STEP 8- Write a summary on VPN benefits and limitations

ProtonVPN Free offers secure AES-256 encryption, no-logs privacy, and unlimited data. It’s reliable for basic browsing and privacy protection. Limitations include fewer server choices and slightly slower speeds compared to the paid plan.
